0	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	78	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	In lung tumors, TRAF6 levels can become elevated by several mechanisms:	"GATA2lox/lox   Sporadic infection of lung cells with Adeno-Cre virus 	GATA2 loss induces regression of established tumors"	1.4
1	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	56	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Alterations in Oct-4 expression promote differentiation and leads to the specification of ectodermal, endodermal or mesodermal primitive progenitors.	Additionally, expression of OCT4 and SOX2 has been shown to affect early differentiation genes such as SOX-17 expression.	1.8
2	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	97	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Three programs, PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan , were used to predict the targets of miR-21.	The genes that decreased 2-fold or more were further screened for possible miR-372/3 target sites using a local version of the TargetScan algorithm.	2.4
3	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	20	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Up-regulation of miR-24 has been observed in a number of cancers, including OSCC.	In addition, miR-24 is one of the most abundant miRNAs in cervical cancer cells, and is reportedly up-regulated in solid stomach cancers.	3.0
4	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	87	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Centrosomes increase both in size and in microtubule-nucleating capacity just before mitotic entry.	Functional studies showed that, when introduced into cell lines, miR-146a was found to promote cell proliferation in cervical cancer cells, which suggests that miR-146a works as an oncogenic miRNA in these cancers.	0.0
5	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	57	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	T47D, MCF-7, Skbr3, HeLa, and Caco-2 cells were transfected by electroporation as described previously.	 MCF7 or HeLa cells were electroporated as described previously to more than 95% efficiency with pSuper constructs against the various targets, and 72 hr later, protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting.	3.0
6	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	81	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Third, human Wts2 is a phosphorylation target of Aurora-A kinase, and this phosphorylation plays a role in regulating centrosomal localization of hWts2 ( Toji et al., 2004)	Similarly to PLK1, Aurora-A activity is required for the enrichment or localisation of multiple centrosomal factors which have roles in maturation, including LATS2 [ 22] and CDK5RAP2/Cnn [ 23] (see [ 10] for a review)	1.2
7	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	0	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	It has recently been shown that Craf is essential for Kras G12D-induced NSCLC.	It has recently become evident that Craf is essential for the onset of Kras-driven non-small cell lung cancer.	4.0
8	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	92	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	The cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor roscovitine has been reported to down-regulate the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1	Recent work in model systems and acute myelogenous leukemia has suggested that expression of MCL-1 is a key determinant of resistance to ABT-737	2.0
9	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	46	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	miR-Vec constructs were described before, and Dnd1 open-reading frames were cloned as described into a pCS2-based CMV expression vector to contain a double carboxy-terminal HA tag.	The pMSCV-blast-miR plasmids, containing either hsa-miR-376a1 human miRNA or control miRNA (hTR-human telomerase RNA), were constructed as described previously.	1.0
10	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	49	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Consequently miRNAs have been demonstrated to act either as oncogenes (e.g., miR-155, miR-17−5p and miR-21) or tumor suppressors (e.g., miR-34, miR-15a, miR-16−1 and let-7)	Given the extensive involvement of miRNA in physiology, dysregulation of miRNA expression can be associated with cancer pathobiology including oncogenesis], proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, metastasis, aberrations in metabolism, and angiogenesis, among others	2.8
11	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	23	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	miR-223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor I/A (NFI-A) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα)	There is growing evidence from animal systems that miRNA-regulated transcription factors frequently regulate the transcription of their cognate miRNAs.	1.8
12	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	86	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	In PC9 cells, loss of GATA6 and/or HOPX did not alter cell growth, whereas reduction of GATA2 and EGFR inhibited cell viability as previously reported.	Aurora-A is required for the correct localisation and function of centrosomal components like centrosomin, NDEL1, LATS and TACC proteins	0.2
13	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	6	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Recently, it was reported that expression of IDH1R132H suppresses TET2 activity and the mutations of IDH1 and IDH2 genes occur in a mutual exclusive manner with that of TET2 gene in AML	the mechanism was clarified by yet another genomic survey, this time involving acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).	1.6
14	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	73	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Finally, researchers combined available inhibitors selective for two of the pathways regulated by GATA2 to treat mice with Kras-driven NSCLCs.	In PC9 cells, loss of GATA6 and/or HOPX did not alter cell growth, whereas reduction of GATA2 and EGFR inhibited cell viability as previously reported.	1.8
15	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	3	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	More recently, IDH mutations and resultant 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) production in leukemia cells were reported to induce global DNA hypermethylation through impaired TET2 catalytic function.	It has also been recently reported that mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase genes IDH1 and IDH2 can lead to the aberrant production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), a metabolite that inhibits TET2 enzymatic activity, resulting in a hypermethylated promoter phenotype in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) tumors carrying IDH1/2 mutations.	3.2
