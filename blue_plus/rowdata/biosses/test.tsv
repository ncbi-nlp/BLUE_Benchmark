0	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	66	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	This oxidative branch activity is elevated in comparison to many cancer cell lines, where the oxidative branch is typically reduced and accounts for <20% of the carbon flow through PPP.	The Downward laboratory  went all the way from identifying GATA2 as a novel synthetic lethal gene to validating it using Kras-driven GEM models.	0.0
1	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	83	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	We found no obvious effect of LATS2-depletion on the Aurora-A kinase activity when monitored by phosphorylation state of Thr288 on Aurora-A [18] (Fig. S2), suggesting that LATS2 may be a downstream of Aurora-A as mentioned in a previous report [8]	Among them, miR-143, miR-145 and miR-34a have been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, and miR-146a and miR-21 to increase cell growth	0.2
2	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	14	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Several computational target prediction approaches, such as TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda, PITA, DIANA-microT and RNAhybrid, have been developed to predict target genes.	Three programs, PicTar, miRanda, and TargetScan , were used to predict the targets of miR-21.	2.4
3	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	74	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	They identified that some genes involved in RHO-related signaling pathways were occupied by GATA2 in KRAS mutant but not wild-type tumor cells.	The researchers combined available inhibitors selective for two of the pathways regulated by GATA2 to treat mice with Kras-driven NSCLCs	2.0
4	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	63	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Expression of an activated form of Ras proteins can induce senescence in some primary fibroblasts.	The senescent state has been observed to be inducible in certain cultured cells in response to high level expression of genes such as the activated ras oncogene.	3.6
5	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	22	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Furthermore, a very recent study demonstrated the mechanism that specifies myeloid expression of miR-223 and proposed a unique “minicircuitry” comprised of miR-223 and transcription factors, NFI-A and CAAT enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα)	miR-223 regulates granulopoiesis by a feedback mechanism and is modulated competitively by the transcription factors nuclear factor I/A (NFI-A) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα).	3.4
6	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	38	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	In eukaryotic cells, small G-proteins are critically regulated by Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) and GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs).	Eukaryotic small G-proteins are often controlled through the balancing actions of GAPs and GEFs.	4.0
7	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	12	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Furthermore, transiently expressed exogenous LATS2 is localized to centrosomes.	LATS1 and LATS2 have been detected on interphase and mitotic centrosomes	3.0
8	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	59	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	A few studies have reported the control of APC/C by genotoxic stress in mammalian cells, Ionizing radiation was shown to activate the APC/C to degrade cyclin D1, which triggers an immediate p53-independent G1 arrest.	In fact, genotoxic stresses such as ionizing radiation have been demonstrated to trigger rapid proteolysis of cyclin D1, leading to p53-independent G1 arrest.	3.8
9	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	18	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Recently, miR-126 was identified as a metastasis suppressing miRNA that is downregulated in relapsing breast cancer, leukemia, and cervical cancer.	Subsequent reports showed that miR-126 targeted the oncogene IRS-1 (insulin receptor substrate-1) in breast cancer cells and miR-126 was downregulated in cervical cancer.	3.2
10	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	33	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	The oncogenic activity of mutant Kras appears dependent on functional Craf, but not on Braf	Notably, c-Raf has recently been found essential for development of K-Ras-driven NSCLCs	3.0
11	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	68	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	Considerable evidence indicates that cancer cells develop dependencies on normal functions of certain genes that can potentially be exploited to improve therapeutic strategies.	 In the case of cell response to stress, cyclin D1 can be degraded through its binding to the anaphase-promoting complex and a RXXL sequence located in the NH2-terminal part of the protein.	0.0
12	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	70	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	A recent study identified the importance of the GATA2 transcriptional network in RAS oncogene-driven NSCLC and suggested effective combinations targeting the proteasome together with IL-1 and Rho-signalling.	Alternatively, the anaphase promoting complex (APC) is responsible for the rapid degradation of cyclin D1 in cells irradiated with ionizing radiation.	0.2
13	GENRE	BIOSSES	1997	79	BIOSSES	BIOSSES	GATA2 is also of considerable interest; genetic ablation leads to tumor regression in mouse models of adenocarcinoma of the lung, and whereas this transcription factor may appear to be the least druggable of targets, its role in regulating the proteasome suggested therapeutic approaches that appear very promising	The GATA2 transcription factor, which is essential for oncogenic K-ras-dependent lung tumor development, binds to the TRAF6 promoter and enhances its expression.	1.8
